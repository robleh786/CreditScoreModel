            <h2>Credit Mix</h2>
            <p>The variety of credit types that you have, such as credit cards, mortgages, and car loans. A diverse credit mix can improve your credit score.</p>

            <h2>EMI (Equated Monthly Installment)</h2>
            <p>A fixed payment amount made by a borrower to a lender at a specified date each calendar month. EMIs are used to pay off both interest and principal each month so that over a specified number of years, the loan is paid off in full.</p>

        <div class="term">
            <h2>Credit Utilization Ratio</h2>
            <p>The ratio of your current total debt to your total available credit. This ratio helps determine your credit score and is a key indicator of your credit health.</p>

        <div class="term">
            <h2>RePayment status</h2>
            <p>Repayment status indicates if a user paid their credit card bill on time or with a delay. Recorded monthly (PAY_0 to PAY_6), values range from -1 (paid on time) to 9 (nine or more months overdue). This helps assess creditworthiness.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="term">
            <h2>Bill amount</h2>
            <p>The BILL_AMT variables represent the billed amount on a client's credit card statement for six consecutive months. The values, recorded as BILL_AMT1 to BILL_AMT6, show the outstanding balance on the card at the end of each month. This helps evaluate the client's credit usage and financial behavior.</p>
